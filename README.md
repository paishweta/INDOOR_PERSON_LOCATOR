# INDOOR_PERSON_LOCATOR

Indoor location, navigation, and mapping are one of the most interesting and growing fields of research in areas of Localization using IoE. From the above mentioned, this project focuses on locating the indoor position of a human entity within a given space (college campus). The use of sensors embedded in mobile phones as well as Bluetooth modules and an Arduino board, placed within a specific room, at different points in the campus, which will pass information to a remote database such as Firebase, enables one to locate a person in the proximity of the sensors. Along with this our proposed system plans to have features of identifying a change in position due to movement and distance & time calculation in order to reach the person. The whole inspiration for this project stems from the frustrating and tiring experience of not being able to find the right individual(s) at the right time. In traditional methods, this would require one to call or message the person and wait for the person to respond and reach the required destination or ask other people where the individual(s) might be. To avoid this, an Android application is proposed that would enable users to know their current location, search the location of a particular person and also see a list of the people who searched for them during that day.
